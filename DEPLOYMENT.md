## Post-Deployment Testing

Once your app is deployed, test LaunchDarkly:

1. **Visit your deployed URL** (e.g., `https://your-app.onrender.com`)

2. **Verify the app is working** - you should see product recommendations

3. **Test LaunchDarkly Feature Flags**:
   - Go to your LaunchDarkly dashboard
   - Find the `chat-helper-v1` AI Config
   - **Disable** the AI Config
   - Refresh your deployed app - it should show "AI Config is disabled"
   - **Enable** the AI Config again
   - Refresh your app - it should work normally

4. **Experiment with different configurations** in LaunchDarkly and see how they affect your deployed app

## Important Notes

- **API Keys**: Never commit your `.env` file to git. It's already in `.gitignore`
- **Environment Variables**: Always use environment variables in deployed environments, never hardcode keys
- **Billing**: Some platforms offer free tiers, but check pricing before deploying
- **Cold Starts**: Free tiers may have cold starts (slower first request after inactivity)

## Monitoring

- Monitor your OpenAI API usage to avoid unexpected costs
- Check LaunchDarkly dashboard for AI Config usage and performance metrics
- Monitor your deployed app's logs for any errors

## Troubleshooting Deployment Issues

### Build Failures
- Check that all dependencies are in `package.json`
- Verify Node.js version compatibility

### Runtime Errors
- Check environment variables are set correctly
- Verify API keys are valid and have proper permissions
- Check application logs for specific error messages

### Timeout Issues
- Some platforms have request timeouts on free tiers
- Consider upgrading if you need longer processing times

## Need Help?

- Check the main README.md and SETUP.md for configuration help
- Review LaunchDarkly documentation
- Check platform-specific documentation for deployment issues
